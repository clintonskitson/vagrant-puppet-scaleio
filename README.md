**Summary - vagrant-puppet-scaleio**

This repository houses a Vagrantfile and Puppet configuration files that allow you to deploy and scale-up/out a ScaleIO storage environment.  It makes use of the ```puppet-scaleio``` module to perform all of the configuration and ```Vagrant``` to deploy a Puppet Master, configure Puppet with ScaleIO module, and then deploy additional defined ScaleIO nodes.

With this Vagrantfile, it is possible to deploy pre-defined ScaleIO clusters.  Further, the ScaleIO puppet module allows you to deploy massive descriptive ScaleIO clusters across any environment, physical or virtual in minutes.

**ScaleIO Downloads**
A new feature of this Vagrantfile is to download the latest ScaleIO RPM's automatically.  This is done automatically and can be disabled by editing the Vagrantfile and commenting out ```download_scaleio```.
